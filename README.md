# SkyHigh Modifications Fxmanifest Generator

The FXManifest Generator is a tool designed to simplify the process of creating a manifest file for FiveM, a popular multiplayer modification framework for Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). Let's break down its purpose, usage, and features:

## Key Features:
- **Ease of Use:** The generator provides a user-friendly interface for inputting resource details and selecting data files.
- **Automatic Formatting:** Developers don't need to worry about the correct syntax or formatting of the manifest file. The generator handles this automatically.
- **Data File Selection:** It offers a list of common data files used in FiveM resource development, simplifying the process of specifying dependencies.
- **Version Checking:** The generator includes functionality to check for updates, alerting users if a newer version is available.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Users can toggle between light and dark modes for better visibility and customization.

## Usage:
- Developers input various details about their resource, such as the FX version, game name, version number, author information, and descriptions.
- They can also specify the data files used by their resource, such as `vehicles.meta`, `carcols.meta`, etc., along with their respective file paths.
- After providing all necessary information, developers can click the "Generate Manifest" button.
- The generator then compiles all the provided information into a correctly formatted `fxmanifest.lua` file.
- Additionally, it provides a download link for the generated manifest file, allowing developers to easily incorporate it into their FiveM server setups.

## Purpose:
- FiveM requires developers to create a fxmanifest.lua file to specify which resources (such as scripts, assets, etc.) are used in their custom server setups.
- The FXManifest Generator automates the creation of this manifest file, reducing the manual effort required by developers.
